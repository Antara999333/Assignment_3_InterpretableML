# INTERPRETABLE MODELS
I have used data from Kaggle.com ((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/code). This data pertains to Telco's customer information and churn information. In this exercise, we are trying to find the relationship between the various features in the dataset and the 'churn' outcome. We are fitting multiple models, Linear regression, Logistic regression and GAM to evaluate the performance across these models in terms of predicting the likelihood of churn for a given individual.
